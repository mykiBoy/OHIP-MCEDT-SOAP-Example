# OHIP-MCEDT-SOAP-Example
Ontario Ministry of Health's MCEDT web service. A working example to access the conformance testing API with a valid SOAP request message. Valid certificate included to enable WSS security. You should be able to just plug in your conformance testing key, username, password and MOH ID.
Hope this helps those who find the MOH's technical documents lacking, and if this helps you, please give the youtube video tutorial a like. If you have better implementation of code, please share in the comments.
